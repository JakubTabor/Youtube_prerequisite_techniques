# Now we are gonna create Flexbox, it requires container and the elements are gonna be inside our Flexbox
* First we need to change the style of our container in display to flex
* Next we set flex-direction to row and these means that we are gonna align our elements horizontally
* So inside Flexbox the <div>, which is block-element, don't behave like block-element
* But like inline-block element, they take as much horizontal space as they needed
* When we add some text to the <div> it expand and will take only as much space as it need to
* If we make second div taller aading por example paragraph, the flexbox will be vertically aligned
