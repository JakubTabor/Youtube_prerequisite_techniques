# Now we are gonna create Flexbox, it requires container and the elements are gonna be inside our Flexbox
* First we need to change the style of our container in display to flex
* Next we set flex-direction to row and these means that we are gonna align our elements horizontally
* So inside Flexbox the <div>, which is block-element, don't behave like block-element
* But like inline-block element, they take as much horizontal space as they needed
* When we add some text to the <div> it expand and will take only as much space as it need to
* If we make second div taller aading por example paragraph, the flexbox will be vertically aligned
* So the Flexbox is another way to create the horizontal layouts in our video-previews, while maintaining alignment

# Now when we add a new style, which is flex and set it to 1 the element will take the remaining amount of space
* flex1 element is equivalent to fr1 in grid
* But for grid the layout is more rigid, because first we need to define the columns
* And with grid we need to be careful when changing the order
* In flex box when we change the order the layout keeps its shape, so it's flexible
* The advantage of flexible layout depending on our content is the case when we resize the browser

# The flexbox will help us to build the header
* To make our flexbox how it is aligned hirizontaly, by seting property justify-content
